# streamlit_pytorch_detectron2
Streamlit an open source library used to make data apps really easily. In this I am trying to deploy a detectron2 pytorch model through streamlit


1. Download model_final.pth from GitRelease
2. move model_final.pth to \streamlit_pytorch_detectron2\detectron2\output\

- go to detectron2 folder, run file deploy_bruh.py
streamlit run deploy_bruh.py
